  ;; Write an interactive function that searches for a string.  If the
  ;; search finds the string, leave point after it and display a message
  ;; that says “Found!”.  (Do not use ‘search-forward’ for the name of this
  ;; function; if you do, you will overwrite the existing version of
  ;; ‘search-forward’ that comes with Emacs.  Use a name such as
  ;; ‘test-search’ instead.)
