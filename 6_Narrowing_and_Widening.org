  ;; Write a function that will display the first 60 characters of the
  ;; current buffer, even if you have narrowed the buffer to its latter
  ;; half so that the first line is inaccessible.  Restore point, mark, and
  ;; narrowing.  For this exercise, you need to use a whole potpourri of
  ;; functions, including ‘save-restriction’, ‘widen’, ‘goto-char’,
  ;; ‘point-min’, ‘message’, and ‘buffer-substring’.

  ;; (‘buffer-substring’ is a previously unmentioned function you will
  ;; have to investigate yourself; or perhaps you will have to use
  ;; ‘buffer-substring-no-properties’ or ‘filter-buffer-substring’ ..., yet
  ;; other functions.  Text properties are a feature otherwise not
  ;; discussed here.  *Note ``Text Properties'' in The Gnu Emacs Lisp
  ;; Refernce Manual)

  ;; Additionally, do you really need ‘goto-char’ or ‘point-min’?  Or
  ;; can you write the function without them?
